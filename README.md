# Do higher-order interactions promote synchronization?

This repository contains the code used and produced for the analysis presented in the paper:  
"[Do higher-order interactions promote synchronization?][2]" by Yuanzhao Zhang, Maxime Lucas, and Federico Battiston.

The code to compute the multiorder Laplacian is based on the repository https://github.com/maximelucas/multiorder_Laplacian associated to the paper where it was introcuted: Lucas, M., Cencetti, G., & Battiston, F. (2020). [Multiorder Laplacian for synchronization in higher-order networks][1]. Physical Review Research, 2(3), 033410.
